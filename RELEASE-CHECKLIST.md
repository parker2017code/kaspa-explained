# Release checklist

V2 is published at https://kaspaexplained.com from revision `4695529`.
The standalone V1 build remains available; release evidence is recorded below.

## V1: standalone education

- [x] One page registry drives build, search, and sitemap.
- [x] Fresh offline tests replace the obsolete root-site CI entry point.
- [x] Timing model passes the exact 300/301 ms boundary in the browser.
- [x] Money models conserve reserves, debt inputs, and conditional collateral.
- [x] Complete the combined responsive/reduced-motion matrix after interview-driven edits and coordination integration: 150 states, zero findings; manual page-type review and keyboard/browser journeys are documented.
- [x] Verify current V1 claims and source links against dated evidence; see the review notes below.
- [x] Replace legacy implementation dependencies and obsolete guidance; the V1 quickstart uses its independent static build.
- [x] Validate generated page/asset destinations, all 78 compatibility targets, and supported historical-fragment behavior.
- [x] Separate public V1 from local-service-dependent V2 interfaces; fresh-artifact and route tests pass.
- [x] Complete the visual reference comparison and apply the findings across V1; see `design/BROWSER-REVIEW.md`.
- [x] Configure and verify the generated-output deployment.
- [x] Publish the cleaned V1 source; post-publication evidence is in `docs/release-v1.md`.

### V1 evidence and remaining publication steps

The September 6 V1 artifact checks pass for 15 pages, 78 compatibility routes,
required assets, historical-fragment mapping, and exclusion of local-wallet
interfaces. Educational model tests pass. The browser-review document records
manual page-type inspection and keyboard/journey coverage with its limits.

`CLAIMS.yml` records the dated primary-source claim review. The 14:23 UTC
external-link audit returned HTTP success for 39 of 41 URLs; the coordinating
reviewer directly checked the two Kaspa Explorer URLs that returned automated
HTTP 403. This is browser evidence, not a claim that the automated audit passed.

V1 Pages run `34041857828` succeeded for revision `6ef9f73`. Independent
live checks covered home at mobile/desktop widths in both appearances,
keyboard coordination, navigation, search, a legacy fragment and both PDFs.
See `docs/release-v1.md` and `design/live-v1/` for the bounded live review.

## V2: testnet applications

- [x] Native test payment accepted; matching amount verified.
- [x] Refundable transfer recipient claim accepted.
- [x] Sender refund accepted after node-derived eligibility.
- [x] Refund integration checks exact fee conservation and duplicate-spend refusal.
- [x] Signature encoding regression test.
- [x] Receipt pagination and reorganization regression tests.
- [x] Local API rejects unauthorized origins, hosts, and malformed requests.
- [x] Payment-split source compiles with the pinned compiler.
- [x] Payment split executes and verifies both recipients on Testnet-10.
- [x] Exact repository contracts pass pinned VM execution tests with explicit script-unit limits: signature roles, refund timing, split destinations, rounding, counts, fees, and invalid allocations.
- [x] Public escrow, treasury, prediction and fixed-proof browser transactions accepted on Testnet-10.
- [x] Public capped-token genesis, mint, move, split, merge, atomic exchange and burn accepted; exact IDs and accepting blocks are recorded.
- [x] Fully backed receipt creation, split, merge, move, partial redemption and full redemption accepted.
- [x] Proof verification executes with an explicit 0.2 tKAS fee cap and an honest fixed-fixture/privacy boundary.
- [x] Durable encrypted recovery, exact signed retries, concurrency/uncertainty guards and reorganization tests.
- [x] Reproducible dependency setup with checksums, pinned VM execution and upstream licenses.
- [x] Public static architecture: sixteen canonical pages, 87 compatibility routes, six templates; no public local signer.
- [x] Current `check:public`: 19 tests plus public signing checks pass.
- [x] Unfunded browser SDK/recovery gate: 48 states each in Chromium, Firefox and WebKit, using real RPC. Missing-file/wrong-password rejection, all three account identities, both themes and four widths pass.
- [x] Record the two-recipient native payment acceptance and both exact outputs.
- [x] Final funded-state Chromium review: 80 states, no page errors, overflow or private API calls; corrected controls visually rechecked.
- [x] Run final combined release checks on the final source revision.
- [x] Publish V2 source, transaction evidence, limitations and release notes.
- [x] Deploy V2 and verify the custom domain, static SDK/WASM/templates and public routes.

The public-browser sequence contains 24 accepted transactions, with
0.315262 tKAS in fees. See `design/PUBLIC-APPS-REVIEW.md` for every action,
transaction ID, accepting block and reconciliation of the 1.2 tKAS allocation.
That evidence does not imply live coverage of every alternative signature pair,
oracle result or refund branch; the unfunded VM suites provide separate route
and rejection coverage. The older workshop transactions below are historical
evidence and are distinct from the public application sequence.

The two-recipient payment `c9b0b794c4c0cf99417d5a0460db2f33170291dd342bb667358d2f1898dc93a2`
was accepted in block `d7bc055e63148471510fe9f10d7b08208e59689159191c0ca6f05a73dedde331`.
Its two 0.0401665 tKAS outputs and 0.00306 tKAS fee were independently checked.
The earlier 0.01 + 0.01 proposal was rejected before signing by storage mass;
that earlier rejection is not the outcome of the successfully submitted split.

Pages run `34044565585`, job `101517207218`, successfully deployed revision
`4695529` at 16:21 UTC on September 6. Its corrected dependency sequence passed
all three public VM suites, 52 general tests, 19 public tests plus signing
checks, 144 unfunded browser states, nine browser journeys, and 160 render
states with zero findings.

The live artifact matched all 138 expected files by HTTP response and SHA-256
(`.cache/live-v2-verification.json`). Independent live Chromium and WebKit checks
passed 48 states each: SDK loading, account creation, encrypted file/local
restore, missing-file/wrong-password errors, four widths and both themes.
There were no page exceptions or private API calls, and those checks sent no
funds. Evidence is under `.cache/visual-review/public-live/`. The live application
screenshot was visually inspected; the mainnet lookup labels its provider data
accurately. These checks do not extend to physical devices or a security audit.

All applications are experimental, unaudited, Testnet-10 only, and never
intended for mainnet. Simulations are not counted as native implementations.

Accepting block: `7f20d1c60693c789d3f66d8a4687b26ffdbac6f25440bebff7f06ce4350a0b6e`.

These record a node observation at test time, not permanent finality or an audit.

Payment split: `77d1c8d1f2bae3a814dbcd71cef2d59a9523f57ab2fa065ebbc20a9edf080def`.
Accepting block: `e61de336628b472737ba40f4e3616b182ec8cf984949525eaa3d3258318d22ad`.
Outputs: 33,252,674 and 66,515,326 sompi; fee: 232,000 sompi.
The outputs plus fee equal 100,000,000 sompi. The additional VM tests execute
these exact source files, not the live transactions. They do not replace node
eligibility, mempool, reorganization, or public-service security testing.

Browser QA wallet funding: `5d3722fa9476455719e08cc75c7e818a4aebe5971f3ace93a2cd3deb8249c878`.
Accepting block: `878c4e58aa0e95e0a74167bc7073508b0b2e2ec9e567251bad7c1896dd66d391`.
At 2026-09-06 14:31 UTC, the node showed exactly 30,000,000 sompi at the
browser QA address. Fee: 264,800 sompi. Cumulative local-wallet test allocation
is now 641,310,100 sompi (6.413101 tKAS) against the 10 tKAS cap. Browser tests
spend from this allocated amount; this funding observation is not evidence
that an application contract has executed.
